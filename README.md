# Heart-Disease-Prediction

**Background:**

* World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardiovascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This project intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression, decision tree and random forest.

**Dataset:**

* The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
  • Sex
  • Age
  • Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker
  • Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.
  • BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication • Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke • Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive
  • Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes
  • Tot Chol: total cholesterol level
  • Sys BP: systolic blood pressure
  • Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure
  • BMI: Body Mass Index
  • Heart Rate: heart rate
  • Glucose: glucose level
  • 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD
  
**EDA:**

* Distribution of Boolean Variables

* Distribution of Continuous Variables

**Models:**

* Logistic Regression

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest

**Conclusions:**

  *In terms of accuracy, the best model is the decision tree. In terms of variable abundance, the best model is the logistic regression.
  *The patient that was hypertensive or had diabetes shows increasing odds of having heart disease. Increase in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic Blood Pressure also show increasing odds of having heart disease.
  *Men seem to be more susceptible to heart disease than women.
  *Meanwhile, people under the age of 48.5 have a very low probability of suffering from heart disease.
